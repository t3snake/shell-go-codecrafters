# Shell Code Summary

This directory contains the core implementation of the shell. The code is organized into several main components:

## Main Components

### 1. Main REPL Loop (`main.go`)
- **REPL Loop:**  
  The `execREPL` function loops indefinitely, printing a prompt (`$ `) and then waiting to read user input via a custom raw-mode line reader.
- **Command Parsing & Execution:**  
  - The input is parsed into arguments by the `parseArgs` function, which handles quotes, escapes, and spaces.
  - The shell first checks for built-in commands (`echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `history`, `type`, and `exit`).  
  - If a command is not a built-in, it looks for the executable in the system `PATH` using `isInPath` and executes it via `execPathCmd`.
- **Redirection:**  
  The `fileForRedirect` function inspects the arguments for redirection operators (such as `>`, `2>`, `>>`, `2>>`) and, if found, the output is written using `writeResultToFile`.

### 2. Raw Terminal Input and Line Editing (`terminal_read_line.go`)
- **Raw Mode:**  
  The terminal is switched to raw mode (using `golang.org/x/term`) so that the shell can handle each keypress immediately.
- **Input Handling:**  
  Characters are read one-by-one. Special handling is provided for:
  - **Tab (`\t`):**  
    Triggers auto-completion by determining the last word (using `calculateLastWord`), searching the prefix tree (from `auto_completion.go`), and either autocompleting directly or listing possible completions.
  - **Backspace (`\b` / 127):**  
    Removes the last character from the input and updates the screen (using ANSI escape sequences to move the cursor and clear characters).
  - **Ctrl+C (ASCII 3):**  
    Returns an error (`SIGINT`), which in the REPL loop results in an exit with code 130.
  - **Newline/Carriage Return (`\n`, `\r`):**  
    Ends the current input line and returns the collected input.
  - **Arrow Keys:**  
    Supports up/down navigation for command history.
- **Utility Functions:**  
  - `echoLetterAndAppendToBuffer` prints a typed character and appends it to the input buffer.
  - `redrawBuffer` clears the current input area and redraws the updated buffer when needed (e.g., after a deletion or history navigation).

### 3. Auto-Completion (`auto_completion.go`)
- **Prefix Tree (Trie) Construction:**  
  The prefix tree is built in `buildAutocompletionDB` from both the list of built-in commands and external commands pulled from the directories listed in the systemâ€™s `PATH` (via `getCommandsFromPath` and `getCommandsFromDir`).
- **Insertion and Searching:**  
  - `addToPrefixTree` inserts each command into the tree.
  - `searchPrefixTree` walks the tree based on the current input prefix to find matching commands.
  - `getAllChildrenAsList` recursively collects all completions from a given node.
- **Common Denominator:**  
  The function `getCompletionDenominator` is used to identify and auto-complete the common prefix among multiple completions as a partial completion.

### 4. History Handling (`history.go`)
- **History Storage:**  
  A simple array stores the history entries (each containing the full command string and an identifier).
- **Updating History:**  
  The `addToHistory` function appends new commands to the history, to be later navigated using the arrow keys in the raw input mode or listed with the built in history command.

## Overall Workflow

1. **Start-up:**  
   The shell initializes the working directory (`pwd`), builds the auto-completion database, and initializes the history array.
2. **REPL Execution:**  
   The main loop in `main.go` prints the prompt, calls `terminalReadLine` to gather a full user command, and then parses and executes that command.
3. **Command Processing:**  
   - Built-in commands are processed internally.
   - External commands are located (using the PATH) and executed.
   - Redirection operators cause the output/error to be written to the specified file.
4. **Cleanup:**  
   Upon exiting (or on receiving a signal like Ctrl+C), the shell returns the appropriate exit code.

This summary should give you an overall understanding of how the shell functions and how its components interact.
